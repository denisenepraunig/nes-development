# NES Development
Ressources for NES development. Currently focusing on assembly language but looking into C, too, nesasm and development on Mac.

The NES uses the 6502 processor and was programmend in assembly.

# Getting Started Assembly
* [Easy6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) - Start writing 6502 assembly in the browser.
* [Assembly in One Step](http://nesdev.com/6502guid.txt) - This is a nice and short quickstart guide for assembly and I really like the explanation of the different addressing modes. Combine this with the [Easy6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) and you are good to go. 
* [Programming the 6502](https://archive.org/details/Programming_the_6502_OCR/page/n51/mode/2up) - This is an ebook which you can read online or download about 6502 programming. It is a full fledged book and not a quickstart guide.

# 6502 Opcodes
The commands for the 6502 are called **opcodes**. An example opcode is ```INX```which increases the value in the X register. Don't worry if this sentence doesn't make sense. After reading [Easy6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) it will make sense ðŸ˜Š.
* [6502 Opcodes](http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html)
* [6502 Opcodes - Instruction Reference](http://www.obelisk.me.uk/6502/reference.html)
* [Opcodes MNEMONIC](./overview-opcodes-6502-alphabetical.md) - Summary of the meaning behind the opcodes

# Getting Started NES Development
## Assembly
* [Nerdy Nights](https://nerdy-nights.nes.science/) - Assembly and nesasm - THE tutorials for getting started with NES development, everybody is refering to them.
* [NES Basics and Our First Game](http://thevirtualmountain.com/nes/2017/03/06/getting-started-with-nes-game-development.html) - Assembly and nesasm, unfortunatelly stops before it gets really interesting - but it is a great starter
* [Famicom Party](https://book.famicom.party/) - Another great introdcution into the NES system and assembly. I really hope this series continues.
## C
* [NES Doug](https://nesdoug.com/) - I haven't read this series yet as I am focusing on assembly currently, but it looks very promising including a platformer tutorial. It uses the CC65 C compiler.

# Videos
* [How video games were made - part 1: Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqyC_S56B3k) - This is a nice overview video about the components of the NES and stuff like pattern tables and alike. Other systems are covered at the end of the video. I highly recommend watching this video!
* [How video games were made - part 2: Workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo7UkkGC1AY) - This video features different consoles and techniques and it is very informative. Really interesting to see the development setup many years ago.
* [Writing NES games! With Assembly!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXbMCKMJXXQ) - This is a very cool overview talk about the NES components you need to know for programming and the excitement of this guy of his first sprite on the screen is really amazing!!
* [Programming the Nintendo Entertainment System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT95C4fT6zA) - This is a dry run of a talk and this guy goes over the basics of the NES and assembly and he niecly compares assembly code and with high level language coding. Also the audio examples of the different channels are really cool
* [Scrolling on the NES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfrNnwJrujw) - In this video you see how the **nametables** are used when scrolling and how they are mirrored and it also explains the reason behind the flickering (seam) at the right edge of Super Mario Bros. 3. The whole channel has a lot of retro game mechanics explained and is very interesting to watch.

# Books
* [Making Games for the NES](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-NES-Steven-Hugg-ebook/dp/B07VVJ15JJ/) - In this book you are using the CC65 C compiler and and [online IDE](http://8bitworkshop.com/) and in the end the book also goes over assembly. I bought it but I haven't read it yet.
* [Retro Game Dev](https://www.retrogamedev.com/) - Currently there is an [C64 book](https://www.retrogamedev.com/c64edition) available which also uses 6502 assembly. On his website you see that a NES book is in the making. I bought the C64 book to see what I can learn for NES development.
* [Programming the 6502](https://archive.org/details/Programming_the_6502_OCR/mode/2up) - If you are serious about assembly programming you can look into this book. You can also download it in various formats.

# Magazines
* [Dev Cart](https://www.amazon.com/Dev-Cart-Special-Introductory-Issue/dp/1724948008/) - This magazine focuses on the NES and has interviews with people doing homebrew, they also have development 6502 assembly tutorials (except in the 0th Introductory Issue) and other related NES news.

# References
* [NES Programming](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/NES_Programming) - Hardware overview, CPU memory addresses, PPU addresses and so on
* [NES Dev Wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev_Wiki) - A lot of information about the NES and all its technical details

# Development Setup
## Sublime Text 3
I am currently using Sublime Text 3 to write my code and compile the game on the command line with the ```nesasm```command (see the [NES Basics and Our First Game](http://thevirtualmountain.com/nes/2017/03/08/nes-basics-and-our-first-game.html) for the setup of ```nesasm```). 

I found a nice Sublime Text assembly syntax highlighter from [nesrocks.com](https://nesrocks.com/blog/nes-homebrew-source-code/#more-412) inside their demo game. I copied the file to my repo with credits inside the file (.sublime-syntax file).

## Sprite Editor
I am using a Mac and did not setup wine yet. The recommended editor seems to be [YY-CHR](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=22338). 

I am currently doing my first steps with this [online NES Sprite Editor](https://erikonarheim.com/NES-Sprite-Editor/) written in JavaScript which is also open source and he [blogged about it](https://erikonarheim.com/posts/nes-sprite-editor). You can upload CHR files or create your own files.

## Online IDE
[8bitworkshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/) offers an online IDE for various retro systems including the NES and has also books available which I listed in the books section.

# Pixel Art
## Pixel Logic
There are a lot of great pixel art tutorials and videos out there but I didn't find any comprehensive book which you can use as a reference until I found the [Pixel Logic](https://pixellogicbook.com/) book. It is worth every cent and I can highly recommend it.

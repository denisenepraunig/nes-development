# Development Setup
## Sublime Text 3
I am currently using Sublime Text 3 to write my code and compile the game on the command line with the ```nesasm```command (see the [NES Basics and Our First Game](http://thevirtualmountain.com/nes/2017/03/08/nes-basics-and-our-first-game.html) for the setup of ```nesasm```). 

I found a nice Sublime Text assembly syntax highlighter from [nesrocks.com](https://nesrocks.com/blog/nes-homebrew-source-code/#more-412) inside their demo game. I copied the file to my repo with credits inside the file (.sublime-syntax file).
